# News-Summarization
News Summarization Using Fine-Tuned LLMs - T5, PEGASUS and BART (LLMs, NLP, MLOps)
•	Developed an AI-powered web application for real-time abstractive news summarization.
•	Configured Google Cloud Vertex AI with NVIDIA L4 GPU and Google Cloud Storage Bucket for computational efficiency.
•	Utilized PyTorch, Transformers and Rouge for LLM models development and evaluation.
•	Fine-tuned three state-of-the-art LLMs - T5, PEGASUS, and BART - for optimal summarization performance.
•	Achieved Rouge scores of 0.25, 0.39, and 0.48 for fine-tuned T5, PEGASUS, and BART models, respectively, demonstrating the high accuracy and reliability of the summarization models.
•	Designed a Streamlit web app, allowing users to select from T5, PEGASUS or BART for personalized news summarization. 
•	Seamlessly integrated the fine-tuned LLMs into the app, ensuring immediate and precise summarization responses.
