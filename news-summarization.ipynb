    "Extractive summarization involves identifying and extracting key phrases, sentences, or segments directly from the original text to form a condensed version. It's akin to highlighting parts of the text that are deemed most informative or relevant.\n",

    "Abstractive summarization goes beyond mere extraction; it involves understanding the main ideas and then expressing them in new words. It's akin to reading a text and then explaining it in one's own words.\n",

    "The Bart model was proposed in [BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) by Mike Lewis, Yinhan Liu, Naman Goyal, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Omer Levy, Ves Stoyanov and Luke Zettlemoyer on 29 Oct, 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "BART is a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. It is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Transformer-based neural machine translation architecture. It uses a standard seq2seq/NMT architecture with a bidirectional encoder (like BERT) and a left-to-right decoder (like GPT). This means the encoder's attention mask is fully visible, like BERT, and the decoder's attention mask is causal, like GPT2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pretraining task involves randomly shuffling the order of the original sentences and a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token.\n",
    "BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6 ROUGE.\n",
